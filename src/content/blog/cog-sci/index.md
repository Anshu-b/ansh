## What is Cognitive Science?
Whenever I tell someone that I am minoring in Cognitive Science, they always ask me, **what even _is_ cognitive science?** This is a completely valid question, and before coming to UCSD I probably would've called it a fancy term for _psychology_. From my experience, there is no singular way to define what cognitive science is. I know-this sounds cliche-but cognitive science is such an interdisciplinary subject that your perspective of cognitive science really depends on your specialization. However, for the sake of answering the question-based on many definitions provdided over several classes-**I define cognitive science as the intersection of 5 key domains:**
- Neuroscience
- Psychology
- Linguistics
- Philosophy
- Computer Science

with the goal of being able to understand AND model cognition, perception, language and consciousness through exploration of brain function, AI, language models, and interactions with the world. This definition is a lot to take in, but this is essentially the core of cognitive science; much more than _just_ fancy psychology, now is it? 
## Why Minor in Cognitive Science? 
1. Minoring in cognitive science as a data science student helps me understand how I can apply my knowledge of software and coding to other fields of critical cutting-edge research, especially in AI & LLMs [Intersection of linguistics & computer science] and Data Ethics [Intersection of philosophy & computer science]. 
2. From a logistical standpoint, UCSD's Cognitive Science and Data Science curriculum have significant overlap, ideally allowing me to take the minor without delaying my graduation.
3. UCSD hosts the world's first and one of the best cognitive science departments. Why not learn something your school is a pioneer in & excels at?
## My reccomendation: 
If you think your degree plan can handle the extra workload, I'd reccomend checking some of the classes in the department out. You don't even have to minor or major in the department, you could just take some gen-eds to get introduced to the subject.


## My Cognitive Science Coursework
- ### COGS 1: Introduction to Cognitive Science
  - **Professor:** Mary Boyle
  - **Grade:** A
  - **Workload:** Not Much
  - <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/112ary40icpclplcqNw0H-JsJmBcawwAbHoszzjTq0Do/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> **Course Notes** </a>
  - **My Thoughts:**
    - COGS 1 is interesting in that it covers a broad range of topics in cognitive science, from the science to sleep to LLMs and AI.
    - The class is structured as a set of lectures from different professors & researchers in the department, which allows each speaker to present their niche fields of interest within cognitive science. 
    - The basis of the class was based on participation, since ample class participation would waive exams for the class. Our section was damn close to getting a final exam [I may more may not have been part of the reason].
    - Overall, this class is great for someone who wants to know what exactly cognitive science even is, and what fields of research it can be applied to. Additionally, the lectures provide a good opporunity to network with professors and researchers in the field. You can use this to your advantage for finding research opporunities, or even choosing which professors to prioiritize in enrollment.
    - My decisions to take COGS 100 and COGS 150 [specifically with Professor Bergen] were based off of my participation in COGS 1. 

- ### COGS 8: Hands-On Computing
  - **Professor:** Kyle Shannon
  - **Grade:** A
  - **Workload:** Not Much
  - **My Thoughts:**
    - This class was a relatively light, but helpful class to take as a freshman at UCSD. 
    - In contrast with most tech-related courses on campus, the class size was small, allowing most class time to be allocated to small-group activities. This made it easy to get to know people, especially as a Freshman.
    - Got the chance to work with MicroBit [a hardware chip] for the first time and actually use Python in a hardware-integration based setting, rather than coding a calculator or some other arbitrary software. 
    - Worked on 2 primary projects:
      - Inchworm
        - Constructing inch-worm robots with cardboard, small motors, paperclips, and the MicroBit to be able to successfully travel a set distance, and compete in a class-wide race.
      - Speedway Robot
        - Integrating live-camera feeds to change trajectory of the robot based on trained signatures for obstacles, track-lines, and objectives.

- ### COGS 9: Introduction to Data Science
  - **Professor:** Kyle Shannon
  - **Grade:** A
  - **Workload:** Not Much
  - **My Thoughts:**

- ### COGS 14A: Introduction to Research Methods
  - **Professor:** James Barrera
  - **Grade:** A-
  - **Workload:** Decent
  - **My Thoughts:**

- ### COGS 14B: Introduction to Statistical Analysis
  - **Professor:** Drew Ellen Hoffman
  - **Grade:** A+
  - **Workload:** Decent
  - **My Thoughts:**

- ### COGS 100: Cyborgs Now & In the Future
  - **Professor:** Michael Allen Gordon
  - **Grade:** A
  - **Workload:** Decent
  - **My Thoughts:**

- ### COGS 101C: Language
  - **Professor:** Alyssa Truman
  - **Grade:** A
  - **Workload:** Decent
  - **My Thoughts:**

- ### COGS 118B: Introduction to [Unsupervised] Machine Learning
  - **Professor:** Anjum Gupta
  - **Grade:** A
  - **Workload:** Decent
  - **My Thoughts:**

- ### COGS 150: Large Language Models in Cognitive Science
  - **Professor:** Ben Bergen
  - **Grade:** P
  - **Workload:** Decent
  - **My Thoughts:**
