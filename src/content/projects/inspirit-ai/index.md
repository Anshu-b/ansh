- Utilized pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, to train & test data from the USDOJ to predict criminal recidivism rates to remove human bias from jail sentencing and improve existing COMPAS model.
- Tested model with multiple algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest classifier, & neural networks.
- resented the most successful model (~87% accuracy; ~20% increase vs. COMPAS) to a panel of Ivy League alumni.
